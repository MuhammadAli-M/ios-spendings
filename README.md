# ios-spendings

_PS: This is an on-going project._

The app is a progressive clone of [Spendee](https://apps.apple.com/app/spendee/id635861140) application to track money transactions.

## Architecture

Though this app, I used the the clean architecture and MVVM pattern for presenetation.

I used storyboard UI to save time.

## Caching

I used the user defaults for caching with the availability to extend new caching approaches.
